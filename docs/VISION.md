# Vision

Build a CLI-first “council of agents” that can collaboratively research, critique, and converge on the best answer or plan, while preserving a durable audit trail.

## Non-negotiables

- **Beads is the bus**: one Beads issue per council session; all deliberation is recorded as structured comments.
- **Provider diversity**: Codex, Claude, and Gemini participate as peers; the chair is selected automatically.
- **Research-first**: the MVP is read-only (no repo edits); “builder mode” emerges later as a council-designed extension.
- **Artifacts are first-class**: agents can emit arbitrary artifact types (e.g., mermaid diagrams) that are persisted and referenced in the transcript.
