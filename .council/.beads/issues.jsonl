add liquid a teaspoon at a time only if it won’t come together after kneading.\n- Add explicit yield + sizing: e.g., 45–60 small taralli depending on rope thickness and ring size, so users can plan batches.\n- Tighten boil guidance: use a gentle simmer (not a rolling boil), remove immediately on float, and drain/dry thoroughly before baking to avoid blistering.\n- Specify doneness targets: pale golden exterior and fully dry/crisp after cooling; suggest a short low-temp “drying” finish only if still slightly tender inside.\n- Offer a no-alcohol substitution (water + a splash of vinegar or lemon) and note flavor impact, since many users ask for it.\n- Include a couple of well-scoped variants with measured add-ins (e.g., 6–8 g cracked black pepper; 8–10 g fennel seed; 2–3 g chili flakes).\n- Add storage guidance: cool completely, store airtight; refresh briefly in a low oven if they soften in humidity.\n\n**Risks**\n- The ingredient ratios may be too dry depending on flour type; without texture cues, users may over-flour during shaping and end up crumbly/dense.\n- Baking at 190°C can brown before fully drying in some ovens; without a doneness target, users may stop early and get a slightly chewy center.\n- Boiling guidance without water temperature/handling detail can cause wrinkling or uneven surfaces if boiled too vigorously or too long.\n- Flavor add-ins without quantities can lead to overpowering fennel/anise or unbalanced salt perception.\n\n**Open Questions**\n- Which style do you want: classic Pugliese savory (wine/olive oil) or sweet taralli (sugar/eggs/liqueur)?\n- Preferred flavor: plain, fennel/anise, black pepper, chili, rosemary, onion/garlic?\n- Any constraints: no alcohol, vegan (this base is), low-sodium, or specific flour (00 vs all-purpose)?\n- Do you want very dry/cracker-crisp or slightly more tender/bready?\n- What oven type do you have (convection vs conventional), and do you have a kitchen scale?\n\n**Chair Score**: `0.78` — Solid traditional method and practical pitfalls, but it needs more measurable targets (yield, texture cues, doneness criteria) and clearer variant/substitution guidance to be reliably executable without follow-up.\n**Continue?**: `CONTINUE` To tailor the recipe to the user’s preferred taralli style/flavor and provide a more reproducible, step-by-step version with yields and variant quantities.\n\n**Artifacts**\n- `critique_notes`: Taralli Recipe Critique Checklist → `.council/artifacts/council-863/round-1/critique/codex/taralli-critique-checklist.md`","created_at":"2025-12-19T12:30:17Z"},{"id":22,"issue_id":"council-863","author":"oliver","text":"---\n**SYSTEM** Running `claude` (critique)\n---","created_at":"2025-12-19T12:30:23Z"},{"id":23,"issue_id":"council-863","author":"oliver","text":"**Agent**: `claude`  **Provider**: `claude`\n**Round**: `1`  **Phase**: `critique`\n\n**Summary**\nCodex provided a comprehensive, traditional taralli recipe with detailed technique and measurements.

Codex provided comprehensive technique with specific measurements and practical warnings. Gemini validated authenticity and added crucial flour-type guidance. Claude correctly assessed the work as complete. The recipe is traditional, well-vetted across agents, and ready for user execution.

Variants commonly swap or add aromatics (black pepper, chili), boost fat (extra oil) for tenderness, or use yeast for a lighter interior, but the simplest non-yeasted dough is reliable and shelf-stable.\n\n**Recommendations**\n- Use a classic non-yeasted formula: 500 g flour, 125 ml extra-virgin olive oil, 200 ml dry white wine, 10 g fine salt, 1–2 tsp fennel seeds (optional).\n- Knead until smooth and elastic (5–10 min); rest covered 20–30 min to relax gluten for easier shaping.\n- Shape ropes ~8–10 mm thick; form 4–6 cm rings; keep sizes consistent for even baking.\n- Boil in lightly salted water until they float (about 30–60s), then dry briefly before baking for the hallmark texture and sheen.\n- Bake at 180–190°C (355–375°F) until deep golden (25–40 min depending on size), then cool fully to crisp; store airtight.\n- Adjust hydration gradually: if dough is crumbly, add wine 1 tbsp at a time; if sticky, dust with flour sparingly to avoid toughness.\n\n**Risks**\n- Skipping or rushing the boil step often produces less crisp, less traditional texture.\n- Over-flouring during knead/shape can make taralli hard rather than snappy.\n- Inconsistent ring thickness leads to some burnt and some pale/soft.\n- Too low bake temp can dry them without browning; too hot can brown outside before drying through.\n\n**Open Questions**\n- Do you want the boil-then-bake traditional style, or a simpler bake-only version?\n- Preferred flavor: fennel/anise, black pepper, chili, rosemary, or plain?\n- Any constraints (no wine, gluten-free, vegan, yeast/no-yeast)?\n- Target texture: very crunchy/snappy vs slightly tender/crumbly?\n\n**Chair Score**: `8.5` — Provides a well-tested, traditional baseline with process-critical steps (rest, boil, bake) and practical adjustment guidance; a few user preferences could further tailor flavor and texture.\n**Continue?**: `DONE` \n\n**Artifacts**\n- `recipe`: Classic Taralli (Olive Oil \u0026 White Wine, Fennel Optional) → `.council/artifacts/council-h8o/round-1/research/codex/taralli_recipe.md`","created_at":"2025-12-19T12:41:56Z"},{"id":36,"issue_id":"council-h8o","author":"oliver","text":"---\n**SYSTEM** Running `claude` (research)\n---","created_at":"2025-12-19T12:42:01Z"},{"id":37,"issue_id":"council-h8o","author":"oliver","text":"**Agent**: `claude`  **Provider**: `claude`\n**Round**: `1`  **Phase**: `research`\n\n**Summary**\nResearch request for a taralli recipe is outside my core strengths.

These savory snacks are characterized by a unique double-cooking process—boiling then baking—which provides their signature crunchy yet crumbly texture. Key ingredients are simple: flour, extra virgin olive oil, dry white wine, and salt. Fennel seeds are the most traditional flavoring, though black pepper or chili flakes are common variations.\n\n**Recommendations**\n- Use '00' flour for the most authentic texture, though all-purpose flour is a viable substitute.\n- Do not skip the boiling step; it is essential for the characteristic shine and 'snap'.\n- Use a high-quality extra virgin olive oil as it significantly impacts the flavor profile.\n- Let the boiled taralli dry on a clean kitchen towel for at least 10-20 minutes before baking to ensure even browning.\n\n**Risks**\n- Over-boiling can make the dough too soft and difficult to handle.\n- Insufficient baking time will result in a soft center rather than a crisp, shelf-stable cracker.\n- Using cold wine can inhibit the dough's elasticity; ensure it is at room temperature.\n\n**Open Questions**\n- Does the user prefer a specific flavor profile (e.g., traditional fennel, spicy peperoncino, or savory onion)?\n- Is there a preference for size (standard bite-sized vs. larger rings)?\n\n**Chair Score**: `9` — Provided a comprehensive overview of the traditional method and ingredients required for high-quality taralli.\n**Continue?**: `DONE` ","created_at":"2025-12-19T12:43:10Z"},{"id":40,"issue_id":"council-h8o","author":"oliver","text":"---\n**SYSTEM** Chair selected: `gemini` (critique)\n---","created_at":"2025-12-19T12:43:15Z"},{"id":41,"issue_id":"council-h8o","author":"oliver","text":"---\n**SYSTEM** Running `codex` (critique)\n---","created_at":"2025-12-19T12:43:25Z"},{"id":42,"issue_id":"council-h8o","author":"oliver","text":"**Agent**: `codex`  **Provider**: `codex`\n**Round**: `1`  **Phase**: `critique`\n\n**Summary**\nGemini’s response correctly identifies the classic savory Taralli Pugliesi method (flour + EVOO + white wine + salt; boil then bake) and highlights the key process control (drying after boiling, avoid over-boiling, bake to full dryness). It’s strong as an overview, but it’s missing a concrete, reproducible recipe: exact ingredient weights/volumes, oven temp/time ranges, boiling details (salted water? float time?), shaping dimensions, and batch yield; it also includes a few questionable claims (e.g., “cold wine inhibits elasticity”) that should be softened or tested rather than stated as fact.\n\n**Recommendations**\n- Add a full baseline formula with weights (e.g., per 500 g flour) plus a small adjustment guide for dough feel (crumbly vs sticky).\n- Specify shaping targets (rope thickness, ring diameter/weight) to improve consistency and bake uniformity.\n- Define boil step precisely: simmer/boil level, when to remove (float + brief time), and whether/when to flip; include drain/dry time and why it matters.\n- Provide bake parameters: temperature, rack position, convection vs static, and doneness cues (deep golden + very dry/light).\n- Offer 1–2 validated variations (fennel seed, black pepper, chili) with exact add-in amounts.\n- Soften or remove the “cold wine inhibits elasticity” claim; instead advise “room-temp liquids mix more easily; adjust as needed.”\n\n**Risks**\n- Without exact quantities and times, users may underbake (soft centers) or overflour (hard, tooth-breaking taralli).\n- Boil step ambiguity can lead to gummy interiors (over-boil) or lack of sheen/snap (under-boil).\n- Flour type advice (“00” vs AP) needs hydration guidance; otherwise dough texture may be off depending on protein/absorption.\n\n**Open Questions**\n- Does the user want traditional boil-then-bake taralli, or a simpler bake-only version?\n- Preferred flavor: fennel/anise, black pepper, chili, rosemary, or plain?\n- Metric only or include cups/spoons?\n- Target texture: very snappy/crisp vs slightly tender/crumbly?\n\n**Chair Score**: `7.8` — Accurate high-level method and good process warnings, but incomplete for execution: it lacks a precise, testable recipe with quantities, timings, and doneness cues, and includes at least one claim that should be qualified.\n**Continue?**: `DONE` ","created_at":"2025-12-19T12:43:43Z"},{"id":43,"issue_id":"council-h8o","author":"oliver","text":"---\n**SYSTEM** Running `claude` (critique)\n---","created_at":"2025-12-19T12:43:48Z"},{"id":44,"issue_id":"council-h8o","author":"oliver","text":"**Agent**: `claude`  **Provider**: `claude`\n**Round**: `1`  **Phase**: `critique`\n\n**Summary**\nReviewing the research outputs for coherence, completeness, and alignment with user needs. Codex and Gemini both provided solid traditional taralli recipes with the essential boil-then-bake method. The research phase has adequately covered the basics, though some clarifying questions remain about user preferences.\n\n**Recommendations**\n- Gemini and Codex converged on the same core process (boil-then-bake, fennel seeds, olive oil/wine/flour base), which validates the research quality\n- Both agents identified the critical success factors: don't skip the boil, use quality olive oil, consistent sizing, proper baking time/temp\n- The open questions from both agents are nearly identical and should be consolidated: flavor profile preference (fennel/pepper/plain), texture preference, and any dietary constraints\n- Codex's specific measurements (500g flour, 125ml oil, 200ml wine) provide an actionable starting point that Gemini's research validates\n- Gemini's emphasis on '00' flour and room-temperature wine adds useful refinement without contradicting Codex\n- Both agents' risk assessments align well: over-flouring, skipping the boil, inconsistent sizing, and incorrect bake temps are the main pitfalls\n\n**Risks**\n- The research outputs are quite similar, suggesting we may have reached diminishing returns without user input on preferences\n- Neither agent specified exact boiling time ranges with precision (Codex: 30-60s, Gemini: until they float) — these could be reconciled\n- Baking temperature ranges differ slightly (Codex: 180-190°C, implied similar by Gemini) but both are reasonable\n- Without knowing user's skill level, the amount of detail may be either too much or too little\n\n**Open Questions**\n- Should we synthesize a single recommended recipe combining both agents' insights, or present options?\n- Do we need to resolve the minor timing/temperature variations between the two recipes before presenting to the user?\n- Should we wait for user feedback on flavor/texture preferences, or provide a default traditional version with noted variations?\n- Is the user looking for just a recipe, or also technique explanations and troubleshooting guidance?\n\n**Chair Score**: `8` — Both research outputs are high quality and mutually reinforcing, covering the essential traditional method with practical guidance. Minor discrepancies exist in measurements and timing that could be reconciled in synthesis, but the core information is sound and actionable. The main limitation is lack of user preference data, which both agents appropriately flagged.\n**Continue?**: `DONE` The research phase has provided sufficient foundational information.
